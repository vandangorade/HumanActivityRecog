## About The Project

### Problem Statement


## Approach

1) We will apply classical Machine Learning models on these 561 sized domain expert engineered features.

2)As we know that LSTM works well on time-series data, so we have decided that we will apply LSTM of Recurrent Neural Networks on 128 sized raw readings that we               
  obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope signals.

### Built With
```sh
 python
 sklearn
 Dask
 matplotlib
 seaborn
 folium
```
